## Title: Analysis of the 2025 WNBA Season

## Authors: Cate Stacy and Karyna Steele

## Project Description

We are analyzing Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) data from the 2025 season.
We have access to play-by-play, team box score, and player box score data.
We plan on exploring factors that contribute to the success of teams and individuals.

## Research Questions

-   What factors, such as points scored, turnovers, or fouls, influence playing time for a WNBA player?

-   What are the characteristics of winning teams?
    Do these characteristics align with the outcome of the championships?

## Inspiration

As student-athletes, we were interested in pursuing a project surrounding women's sports.
In recent years, womenâ€™s basketball has experienced a rapid rise in popularity.
This has coincided with the growth of the WNBA, making it an exciting topic to analyze.

## Data

```{r}
library(wehoop)
library(tidyverse)

wnba_pbp <- wehoop::load_wnba_pbp()
wnba_team_box <- wehoop::load_wnba_team_box()
wnba_player_box <- wehoop::load_wnba_player_box()
```

## Implementation Plan

1)  Clean the data sets (together)

<!-- -->

a.  Identify NA values and filter variables we need to answer our research questions

<!-- -->

2)  EDA (individually) a.Make visualizations and identify variables that could be valuable for our analysis

<!-- -->

b.  Summarize finding and narrow down research questions

<!-- -->

3)  Research (individually)

<!-- -->

a.  Conduct research about the data (ex. How it was collected)
b.  Do background research on topic

<!-- -->

4)  Create preliminary findings presentation (together)

<!-- -->

a.  Collaborate on presentation and present to classmates

<!-- -->

5)  Create data story and present to class (together)

<!-- -->

a.  Ensure that report is clean (hide warnings, ensure there are no long outputs)
b.  Revise according to feedback

<!-- -->

6)  Clean up and organize GitHub repository (together)

<!-- -->

a.  Add README file

<!-- -->

7)  Create presentation slides and video (together)
8)  Evaluation and reflection (individually)
