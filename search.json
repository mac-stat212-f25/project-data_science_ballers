In addition to playing for the championship team, the Las Vegas Aces, she was also named MVP.\n\n\nTeam Dataset\ndimensions:\n\n\nCode\n# get dimensions\ndim(wnba_team_box)\n\n\n[1] 624  57\n\n\nI made running counts of each teams wins and losses so that their records could be determined at any point in the season. I made a visualization showing the cumulative wins for each team over the course of the season.\n\n\nCode\n# determine records for each team\nwnba_team_records &lt;- wnba_team_box %&gt;%\n  filter(team_name != \"TEAM CLARK\", team_name != \"TEAM COLLIER\") %&gt;% # remove All Star teams\n  mutate(\n    win = ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, 1, 0),\n    loss = ifelse(team_winner == FALSE, 1, 0)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(team_name) %&gt;%\n  arrange(team_name, game_date) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    cumulative_wins = cumsum(win),\n    cumulative_losses = cumsum(loss),\n    record = paste0(cumulative_wins, \"-\", cumulative_losses),\n    win_pct = cumulative_wins/(cumulative_wins + cumulative_losses)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(team_color = paste0(\"#\", team_color))\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# visualize records\nggplot(wnba_team_records, aes(x = game_date, y = cumulative_wins, color = team_name)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date(\"2025-09-11\"), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe black line represents the end of the regular season and beginning of the playoffs. The lines for each team end at varying points, depending on when they were eliminated. The Minnesota Lynx had the best record throughout the regular season, but then they were eliminated in the semi-finals. The Aces struggled in the first half of the season but then went on a massive winning streak which took them to the championships.\nNext, I found the teams that led the league in various shot percentages.\n\n\nCode\n# determine teams with the best avg shot percentages\nshot_percentages &lt;- wnba_team_records %&gt;%\n  select(field_goal_pct, free_throw_pct, three_point_field_goal_pct, team_name) %&gt;%\n  group_by(team_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    avg_field_goal = mean(field_goal_pct),\n    avg_free_throw = mean(free_throw_pct),\n    avg_three = mean(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n  )\n\nshot_percentages %&gt;%\n  select(team_name, avg_field_goal) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_field_goal)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  team_name avg_field_goal\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Lynx                46.8\n\n\nCode\nshot_percentages %&gt;%\n  select(team_name, avg_free_throw) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_free_throw)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  team_name avg_free_throw\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Liberty             82.5\n\n\nCode\nshot_percentages %&gt;%\n  select(team_name, avg_three) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_three)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  team_name avg_three\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Lynx           36.7\n\n\nThese shooting stats support the finding from the previous plot that the Lynx had the best regular season record.\nAs a way of comparing how each team typically matched up against their opponents, I calculated the margins for various stats. I then took the averages and displayed the teams with the highest field goal, free throw, and three pointer margins and lowest turnover and foul margins.\n\n\nCode\n# determine game margins for different performance stats\nmargins &lt;- wnba_team_records %&gt;%\n  group_by(game_id) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    field_margin = field_goals_made - rev(field_goals_made),\n    free_margin = free_throws_made - rev(free_throws_made),\n    three_margin = three_point_field_goals_made - rev(three_point_field_goals_made),\n    turnover_margin = turnovers - rev(turnovers),\n    foul_margin = fouls - rev(fouls)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  select(game_id, team_name, field_margin, free_margin, three_margin, turnover_margin, foul_margin) %&gt;%\n  arrange(game_id) \n\n# calculate average margins by team\nmargin_avgs &lt;- margins %&gt;%\n  group_by(team_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    avg_field_margin = mean(field_margin),\n    avg_free_margin = mean(free_margin),\n    avg_three_margin = mean(three_margin),\n    avg_turnover_margin = mean(turnover_margin),\n    avg_foul_margin = mean(foul_margin)\n  ) \n\nmargin_avgs_pivoted &lt;- margin_avgs %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(avg_field_margin, avg_free_margin, avg_three_margin, avg_turnover_margin, avg_foul_margin),\n    names_to = \"margin_type\",\n    values_to = \"margin_value\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    margin_type = fct_relevel(margin_type, \"avg_field_margin\", \"avg_free_margin\", \"avg_three_margin\", \"avg_turnover_margin\", \"avg_foul_margin\")\n  )\n\nmargin_avgs %&gt;%\n  select(team_name, avg_field_margin) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_field_margin)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  team_name avg_field_margin\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Lynx                  3.59\n\n\nCode\nmargin_avgs %&gt;%\n  select(team_name, avg_free_margin) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_free_margin)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  team_name avg_free_margin\n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Liberty              2.66\n\n\nCode\nmargin_avgs %&gt;%\n  select(team_name, avg_three_margin) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_three_margin)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  team_name avg_three_margin\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Dream                 2.83\n\n\nCode\nmargin_avgs %&gt;%\n  select(team_name, avg_turnover_margin) %&gt;%\n  arrange(avg_turnover_margin) %&gt;%\n  slice(1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  team_name avg_turnover_margin\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Storm                   -2.98\n\n\nCode\nmargin_avgs %&gt;%\n  select(team_name, avg_foul_margin) %&gt;%\n  arrange(avg_foul_margin) %&gt;%\n  slice(1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  team_name avg_foul_margin\n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Mystics             -1.43\n\n\nIt is interesting to see a variety of teams represented in these stats. It make sense that the Lynx had the greatest field goal margin given that they had the best record.\nThese faceted bar plots display the average game margins of these stats for each team.\n\n\nCode\n# visualize margins by team\nggplot(margin_avgs_pivoted, aes(x = margin_type, y = margin_value, fill = margin_type)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  facet_wrap(~team_name) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best teams in the league, such as the Lynx, Aces, Dream, and Mercury generally have positive scoring margins and lower or negative turnover and foul margins. The worst teams in the league, such as the Sun, Sky, and Wings display the opposite trends.\n\n\nPlay-By-Play Dataset\n\n\nCode\n# get dimensions\ndim(wnba_pbp)\n\n\n[1] 121342     62\n\n\nFor the play-by-play dataset, I made a variable for the type of shot.\n\n\nCode\n# create shot type variable\nwnba_pbp &lt;- wnba_pbp %&gt;%\n  filter(shooting_play) %&gt;%\n  mutate(shot_type = case_when(\n    str_detect(type_text, \"Jump Shot\") ~ \"Jump Shot\",\n    str_detect(type_text, \"Layup Shot\") | str_detect(type_text, \"Layup\") ~ \"Layup Shot\",\n    str_detect(type_text, \"Free Throw\") ~ \"Free Throw\",\n    str_detect(type_text, \"Hook Shot\") | str_detect(type_text, \"Hook\") ~ \"Hook Shot\",\n    str_detect(type_text, \"Tip Shot\") ~ \"Tip Shot\",\n    str_detect(type_text, \"Dunk\") ~ \"Dunk Shot\"\n  )) \n\n\nThis barplot displays the frequencies of different shot types, differentiated by whether or not the shot was made.\n\n\nCode\nwnba_pbp %&gt;%  \n  filter(game_id != 401781604) %&gt;% #filter out All Star game\n  ggplot(aes(y = shot_type, fill = scoring_play)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumpshots are by far the most common shot, but they are not the easiest to make. Free throws and layups, which make up the majority of the rest of shots, are easier to make.",

    "text": "We read a data story called “Text analysis of Trump’s tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half.” David Robinson looked at a dataset of Trump’s tweets, sent from iPhone and Android. In his analysis, he looked at time of day, hashtag and link usage, retweets, word composition, and sentiment. He concluded that the Android and iPhone tweets are from different people and that the Android tweets (written by Trump) are angrier than the iPhone tweets (written by his campaign). Overall, we thought the report had a nice flow between text, visualizations, and code chunks and is a good model for our project. Listed below are some more detailed observations about the structure of the report.\n\nPresents the driving question/purpose of analysis early on in the data story\nBegins with a brief overview describing the approach taken and main findings before diving into the full details\nDescribes the data\n\nClean, small code chunks interspersed with text to help guide the reader\nSimple clean visualizations effectively display trends in the data\n\nRather than being lumped into a single section, the results and analysis are broken up into specific sections of the investigation\nWraps up analysis in conclusion and explores meaning of findings\nNot very technical, avoids jargon, understandable by wide audience\nVisualizations are simple and have clear messages, but the report could have benefited from at least one more complex, eye-catching visualization\n\nCitation: Robinson, D.
