We have access to play-by-play, team box score, and player box score data.\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\n1) What influences playing time for a WNBA player?\n\n\n2) What are the characteristics of winning teams? Do these characteristics align with the outcome of the championships?\n\n\n\nInspiration\nWe were interested in pursuing a project surrounding sports given that it has many statistics. In recent years, women’s basketball has experienced a rapid rise in popularity. This has coincided with the growth of the WNBA, making it an exciting topic to analyze.\n\n\nData\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nwnba_pbp &lt;- wehoop::load_wnba_pbp()\nwnba_team_box &lt;- wehoop::load_wnba_team_box()\nwnba_player_box &lt;- wehoop::load_wnba_player_box()\n\n\n\n\nImplamentation Plan\n\nClean the data sets (together)\n\n\nIdentify NA values and filter variables we need to answer our research questions\n\n\nEDA (individually) a.Make visualizations and identify variables that could be valuable for our analysis\n\n\nSummarize finding and narrow down research questions\n\n\nResearch (individually)\n\n\nConduct research about the data (ex.
